  Main article: Mobile phones and driving safety
Handsfree mobile phones are obligatory in many countries for use of a mobile phone while driving. However, studies have shown that even with a hands-free unit, the added distraction to the driver, and the increase in crash rates, are almost as substantial as when driving and talking on a normal mobile phone.[5]

In the United Kingdom, as of 2003, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone while driving.[6] Similar laws have been adopted in many jurisdictions worldwide, and many make provisions for hands-free phone use.

Installation of hands-free devices in the UK is governed by MPT 1362, which is now referred to as FCS 1362. A technical document created and updated by the Federation of Communication Services.

In Australia, all states have banned the use of a mobile phone while driving unless it is used with a handsfree headset.

Since handsfree devices replace a phone's own speaker and microphone capability in a phone call, they now also must deal with the same issues that standard mobile phones and land phones deal with. The main acoustic issues are echo cancellation and noise suppression, although there are others as well. There have been many ways developed to cancel echo in phone calls and results range from poor to excellent.

These acoustic technologies must also remove or reduce the noise levels so that the caller is well understood. A person making a call from a handsfree device who is in a busy restaurant or while driving will introduce large levels of noise into the call. This situation is complicated as the software must not only remove the noise around him, but must transmit his voice clearly and loudly to whoever is connected to him.

The best software solutions combine both echo cancellation and noise cancellation into a single technology so that the caller has the freedom to use a handsfree device anywhere they please. Having an acoustic solution with only one feature will dramatically reduce its flexibility.

Snodgrass was born in Paisley, Scotland, the son of the Reverend Dr John Snodgrass, M.A., DD (1744–97), a Presbyterian minister, author and pamphleteer; and Janet, née Mackenzie (1762-1852). His brother was John James Snodgrass. Kenneth Snodgrass enlisted in the British Army in 1802 as an ensign and was promoted to lieutenant in 1804. He served in Sicily and Sweden, was promoted captain in 1808, and fought in the Peninsular War with the Portuguese army from 1809 to 1814. Promoted major, in 1813 he commanded a corps of 400 grenadiers at the battle of Vitoria, then led a forlorn hope in the Siege of San Sebastian. He suffered a severe head wound at the Battle of Orthes in 1814, was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1815, and promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1817. He remained in the Portuguese army until 1822. Snodgrass had married Janet Wright in 1814, during his time stationed in Portugal, where they began raising a family. Eventually they had six children.
He was Acting Governor of New South Wales for two months from late 1837 to early 1838,[3] between the departure of Richard Bourke and the arrival of George Gipps. While in this role Snodgrass despatched a Sydney mounted police detachment to pursue the Namoi, Weraerai and Kamilaroi people who had killed five stockmen in separate incidents on recently established pastoral runs in the upper Gwydir River area of New South Wales.[4] Tragically this led to the events in January 1838 which became known as the Waterloo Creek massacre (or the Australia Day Massacre). On 26 January 1838, a New South Wales Mounted Police detachment led by Major James Nunn murdered perhaps 40 to 50 men, women and children. (Some historians claim up to 300 people were killed).[5] The group attacked an encampment of Kamilaroi people at a place that came to be called Waterloo Creek, in remote north west New South Wales.[6][7][8][9]

However, studies have shown that even with a hands-free unit, the added distraction to the driver, and the increase in crash rates, are almost as substantial as when driving and talking on a normal mobile phone.[5] In the United Kingdom, as of 2003, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone while driving.[6] Similar laws have been adopted in many jurisdictions worldwide, and many make provisions for hands-free phone use. Installation of hands-free devices in the UK is governed by MPT 1362, which is now referred to as FCS 1362. A technical document created and updated by the Federation of Communication Services. In Australia, all states have banned the use of a mobile phone while driving unless it is used with a handsfree headset. Since handsfree devices replace a phone's own speaker and microphone capability in a phone call, they now also must deal with the same issues that standard mobile phones and land phones deal with. The main acoustic issues are echo cancellation and noise suppression, although there are others as well. There have been many ways developed to cancel echo in phone calls and results range from poor to excellent. These acoustic technologies must also remove or reduce the noise levels so that the caller is well understood. A person making a call from a handsfree device who is in a busy restaurant or while driving will introduce large levels of noise into the call. This situation is complicated as the software must not only remove the noise around him, but must transmit his voice clearly and loudly to whoever is connected to him. The best software solutions combine both echo cancellation and noise cancellation into a single technology so that the caller has the freedom to use a handsfree device anywhere they please. Having an acoustic solution with only one feature will dramatically reduce its flexibility. Snodgrass was born in Paisley, Scotland, the son of the Reverend Dr John Snodgrass, M.A., DD (1744–97), a Presbyterian minister, author and pamphleteer; and Janet, née Mackenzie (1762-1852). His brother was John James Snodgrass. Kenneth Snodgrass enlisted in the British Army in 1802 as an ensign and was promoted to lieutenant in 1804. He served in Sicily and Sweden, was promoted captain in 1808, and fought in the Peninsular War with the Portuguese army from 1809 to 1814. Promoted major, in 1813 he commanded a corps of 400 grenadiers at the battle of Vitoria, then led a forlorn hope in the Siege of San Sebastian. He suffered a severe head wound at the Battle of Orthes in 1814, was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1815, and promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1817. He remained in the Portuguese army until 1822. Snodgrass had married Janet Wright in 1814, during his time stationed in Portugal, where they began raising a family. Eventually they had six children. He was Acting Governor of New South Wales for two months from late 1837 to early 1838,[3] between the departure of Richard Bourke and the arrival of George Gipps. While in this role Snodgrass despatched a Sydney mounted police detachment to pursue the Namoi, Weraerai and Kamilaroi people who had killed five stockmen in separate incidents on recently established pastoral runs in the upper Gwydir River area of New South Wales.[4] Tragically this led to the events in January 1838 which became known as the Waterloo Creek massacre (or the Australia Day Massacre). On 26 January 1838, a New South Wales Mounted Police detachment led by Major James Nunn murdered perhaps 40 to 50 men, women and children. (Some historians claim up to 300 people were killed).[5] The group attacked an encampment of Kamilaroi people at a place that came to be called Waterloo Creek, in remote north west New South Wales.[6][7][8][9]
